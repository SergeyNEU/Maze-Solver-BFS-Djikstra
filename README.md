# Maze Finder Program

## Overview
The Maze Finder Program is an interactive puzzle solver designed by Sergey Petrushkevich and Luke Ackerman. This project allows users to solve mazes using two different algorithms: Breadth-first Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's Algorithm. The program is designed to be user-friendly, offering a simple interface for choosing the preferred method of maze solving.

## Features
- **Two Solving Algorithms**: Offers users the option to solve mazes using either Breadth-first Search or Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface for selecting the algorithm and inputting maze data.
- **Flexible Input**: Users can input maze data from a file, allowing for customizable maze puzzles.

## Installation

To install and run the Maze Finder Program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that C++ is installed on your system.
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` or `clang`).
4. Run the compiled executable.

## Usage

Upon running the program, you will be greeted with the following options:

Welcome to the Maze Finder Program!
Select one of the two options:
(1) Breadth-first search
(2) Dijkstra algorithm

Select an option:


Enter `1` for using Breadth-first Search, or `2` for Dijkstra's Algorithm. The program will then prompt you to input or select the maze file.
